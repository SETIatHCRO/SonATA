#JR June 6, 2013 - Removed 2m so Gerry can work on it.
#JR June 6, 2013 - Removed 1a - it is flakey and we think heat may be affecting it. Removing now since
#  we are expecting a heat wave. Need to add it back when it is deemed OK.
#JR June 8, 2013 - Removed 3j from both pols. It is a hot day 100 degrees. bfplot showed 3j may be the culprit.
# JR - Also the 5e-3l baseline shows as bad in bfplot - removing 3l - it showed an elevation of -23.0503
#JR - June 12, 2013 - BF1 problems. Disabled BF1
#JR - june 14, 2013 - BF1 should work now.
